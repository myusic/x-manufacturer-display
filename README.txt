X-Cart Manufacturer Administration

Version: 0.1

X-Cart: 4.6.x, 4.7.x

This module creates an option to organize manufacturers by a set of options you are able to input yourself.
This module assumes:

1. There is a real need to separate and classify your manufacturers beyond standard categorization.
2. There is no viable solution from the existing filter or categorization in x-cart.
3. Your manufacturers are very different from eachother (Toy manufacturer vs. Shoe manufacturer)
