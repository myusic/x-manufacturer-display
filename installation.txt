3. skin/common_files/modules/Manufacturers/manufacturers.tpl

			<td align="center">
			  <select name="records[{$v.manufacturerid}][gender]">
			  <option value="Both" {if $v.gender eq 'Both'}selected{/if}>Both</option>
			  <option value="Men" {if $v.gender eq 'Men'}selected{/if} >Men</option>

4. modules/Manufacturers/manufacturers.php

		'gender'       => $v['gender'],

5. modules/Manufacturers/customer_manufacturers_list.php
	a. Add these lines in approximately 149 replacing the existing smarty variable setting for $manufacturers
	    $manufacturers_m = func_query("SELECT $sql_tbl[manufacturers].*, IFNULL($sql_tbl[manufacturers_lng].manufacturer, $sql_tbl[manufacturers].manufacturer) as manufacturer, IFNULL($sql_tbl[manufacturers_lng].descr, $sql_tbl[manufacturers].descr) as descr FROM $sql_tbl[manufacturers] LEFT JOIN $sql_tbl[manufacturers_lng] ON $sql_tbl[manufacturers].manufacturerid = $sql_tbl[manufacturers_lng].manufacturerid AND $sql_tbl[manufacturers_lng].code = '$shop_language' WHERE avail = 'Y' AND ($sql_tbl[manufacturers].gender = 'Men' OR $sql_tbl[manufacturers].gender = 'Both')ORDER BY $sql_tbl[manufacturers].manufacturer, manufacturer".($objects_per_page > 0 ? " LIMIT $first_page, $objects_per_page" : ""));

        $manufacturers_w = func_query("SELECT $sql_tbl[manufacturers].*, IFNULL($sql_tbl[manufacturers_lng].manufacturer, $sql_tbl[manufacturers].manufacturer) as manufacturer, IFNULL($sql_tbl[manufacturers_lng].descr, $sql_tbl[manufacturers].descr) as descr FROM $sql_tbl[manufacturers] LEFT JOIN $sql_tbl[manufacturers_lng] ON $sql_tbl[manufacturers].manufacturerid = $sql_tbl[manufacturers_lng].manufacturerid AND $sql_tbl[manufacturers_lng].code = '$shop_language' WHERE avail = 'Y' AND ($sql_tbl[manufacturers].gender = 'Women' OR $sql_tbl[manufacturers].gender = 'Both')ORDER BY $sql_tbl[manufacturers].manufacturer, manufacturer".($objects_per_page > 0 ? " LIMIT $first_page, $objects_per_page" : ""));

        if ($_GET['display'] == 'Men') {
            $smarty->assign('manufacturers', $manufacturers_m);
            $smarty->assign('manufacturers_display', 'Men');
        } elseif ($_GET['display'] == 'Women') {
            $smarty->assign('manufacturers', $manufacturers_w);
            $smarty->assign('manufacturers_display', 'Women');
        } else {
            $smarty->assign('manufacturers', $manufacturers);
            $smarty->assign('manufacturers_display', 'All');
        }

	b. urls should have have parameters set to manufacturer.php?display=SETDISPLAYSTRING
		b1. SETDISPLAYSTRING should be the parameter you will use to call the different displays. In this case there is Men, Women, and All(default).
			example: http://www.website.com/manufacturer.php?display=Men
			
		
5. Modification (optional)
	a. To modify the type of selection box change all instances of Gender, Men, and Women. You can add in as many different select options as you need.
	b. To modify the lists additionally, do not change the tpl files. $manufacturers array is best modified in the php.
